Biotechnology is a field that uses living organisms or biological systems to develop products and technologies that improve human life. It combines biology with technology to create solutions in various industries like healthcare, agriculture, and environmental management.
In healthcare, biotechnology is used to develop new medicines, vaccines, and treatments. For example, scientists can genetically modify microorganisms to produce insulin for diabetes or create targeted therapies for cancer. Biotechnology is also crucial in genetic engineering, where DNA is altered to improve crops, making them more resistant to pests or diseases.
In agriculture, biotechnology helps produce genetically modified (GM) crops that yield more and are more nutritious. It also helps reduce the need for harmful pesticides.
Environmental biotechnology involves using microorganisms to clean up pollution and manage waste. Overall, biotechnology is revolutionizing many sectors, offering innovations that address global challenges like health, food security, and environmental protection.
