Nanotechnology is the manipulation and engineering of materials at the nanoscale, typically within the range of 1 to 100 nanometers. This technology enables the creation of new materials and devices with enhanced properties, such as increased strength, lighter weight, improved electrical conductivity, and unique chemical behaviors. In medicine, nanotechnology is used in drug delivery systems, allowing for more targeted treatment with fewer side effects. It also plays a role in diagnostics, where nanoparticles help in detecting diseases at early stages. In electronics, it leads to the development of smaller, faster, and more efficient devices. Nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes and quantum dots, are revolutionizing industries like energy, manufacturing, and environmental science. While offering immense potential, nanotechnology also raises concerns about safety, as the small size and reactive nature of nanoparticles can have unknown impacts on human health and the environment. Ongoing research focuses on harnessing its benefits while minimizing risks.
